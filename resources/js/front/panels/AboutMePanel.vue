        <p class="about-me">
            Since leaving University, i have mainly been working with PHP &amp; Laravel. I also have a solid background in JavaScript &amp; Java but picking up a difference langauge isn't a problem. I am profitiant writting procedual, object orianted and functonal code which provides many different techniques for making my work cleaner.

            I am currently picking up TypeScript and enjoying it as it enables me to write stricter code to overcome some of the limitations that JavaScript present such as Type Inference.

            I am a huge Snooker fan and also enjoying playing competative First Person Shooter games. I also like learning about hardware and electronics and would love to pick up more basics to create simple robots. I have always wanted to learn to play a musical intstument or make YouTube tutorials based on my programming knowledge but have never got round to it.
