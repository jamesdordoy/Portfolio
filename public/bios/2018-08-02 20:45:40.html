<p>My name is James and i have been creating software for over 7 years. Starting with C++ at college, i was captivated by programming and continued learning with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript</p><br>
<p>After learning basic markup languages and JavaScript i learnt VBA for office automation tasks and then started using Microsoft Access Databases for storing data for use with Excel and JavaScript Clients.</p><br>

<p>Before attending University, i also was creating small WordPress websites for customers and my own amusement. After my first year i became captivated by PHP and was using the language for all web projects in L.A.M.P. environments. </p><br>
